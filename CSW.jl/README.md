# The Julia C_SW kernel

NOTE: If you are reading this with a plain text editor, please note that this document is
formatted with Markdown syntax elements.  See https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
for more information.

This is the [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) implementation of the `c_sw` kernel extracted from the FV3 model.

## Dependencies
The following packages are required for building and running this kernel:

* [Julia v1.6](https://julialang.org/downloads/) 
* git
* [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)


## Prerequisites
This code requires git-lfs. Before cloning the repository, verify that git-lfs is installed, by issuing the following command. This only needs to be done once per user per machine.

```bash
$ git lfs install
```

If the above gives an error you (or your systems administrator) may need to install git-lfs.

Some systems that use modules to manage software provide git with git-lfs support via a
module (e.g. `module load git`).  If you are using a system that uses modules, use
`module avail` to look for alternative versions of git that may have git-lfs support.

Make sure the files in `data/inputs` are NetCDF data files (not text) before proceeding to
the build step. A simple way to do that is with the file command as shown below:

```
$ file data/inputs/*
data/inputs/c_sw_12x24.nc: NetCDF Data Format data
data/inputs/c_sw_24x24.nc: NetCDF Data Format data
data/inputs/c_sw_48x24.nc: NetCDF Data Format data
data/inputs/c_sw_48x48.nc: NetCDF Data Format data
```

**NOTE**: If you cloned the repository with a version of git without git-lfs installed, or before you ran `git lfs install`, you
must run the following command (with a version of git that does support git-lfs) from the base
of the repository to fetch the input data before proceeding to the build steps. Or you can
reclone the repository with git-lfs installed, instead.

```bash
$ git lfs pull
```

Alternatively, you can reclone the repository with git-lfs installed.

## Building the kernel

* [Julia v1.6](https://julialang.org/downloads/) is required to build & test the kernel.
* Internet access is required to install the Julia package dependencies. 


There are alternative ways to complete the steps below. If Julia is installed on the machine in use, you may use Julia's built in [package manager](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/getting-started/#Getting-Started-with-Environments).


### Basic build procedure (from the directory containing this file)

From this directory, open the Julia REPL.

```bash
$ julia --project
```
From within the Julia REPL, run the following commands. 

```julia 
using Pkg 
Pkg.instantiate()
```

If you'd prefer not to enter the Julia REPL: 

```bash 
julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

### Machines that do not have Julia installed

#### TODO:
* Create a 'standalone' Julia implementation.

* Use: [BinaryBuilder.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl)
       & [PackageCompiler.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl)

## Testing the kernel

Two additional steps are required to create the test output directories before testing the kernel:

```bash
$ julia --project=. -e 'mkdir("test/test_output")'
$ julia --project=. -e 'mkpath("../data/outputs")'
```

From the Julia REPL: 

```julia 
include("test/test_c_sw.jl")
```
If you'd prefer not to enter the Julia REPL, run: 
```bash
$ julia test/test_c_sw.jl
```

To run a specific test call julia with the `test/single_regression.jl` file providing the argument of the dataset you'd like to test. The available datasets are contained in the [inputs.TOML](test/data/inputs/inputs.toml) file.

For example: 

```bash 
$ julia test/single-regression.jl c_sw_12x24
```

## Build and test script

For convenience, a build script is provided that builds the code and runs the test suite.

```bash
sh build.sh
```

## Installation and running


## NOTES:

## Here is a list of the files and what they contain.


- `src/` contains the kernel source code
- `test/` contains the tests, test input, and test output
- `test/data/outputs` is where test output data is written
- `test/test_input` contains the test input TOML configuration file
- `../Baselines` contains the test baselines

## Troubleshooting

1. All tests fail on my machine.

    Check to make sure git-lfs is installed and that all files in `data/inputs` are NetCDF 
    data files and are not text. Run `git lfs pull` to download NetCDF files if necessary.

2. I get `Skipping object checkout, Git LFS is not installed.` when running `git lfs pull`

    Run `git lfs install` to perform the one-time installation that git-lfs requires per user per machine.

3. I get `git: 'lfs' is not a git command.` when running `git lfs pull`

    Your version of git does not support git-lfs. Install git-lfs or load a version of git that supports it.

4. I get `git-lfs smudge -- 'data/inputs/c_sw_12x24.nc': git-lfs: command not found` when cloning.

    Your version of git does not support git-lfs. Install git-lfs or load a version of git that supports it.
